To prepare samples to be used for model development, run the specified files in order in MAtLab:

- `annotationExtraction.m` : to extract the locations that are manualy selected using the Anootation-Toolbox.

- `makeListofFilesWithLables.m`: to randomly allocate samples for the training, validation and testing subgroups and write the list of these files in separate txt files, which will be uploaded later to the Caffe platform for training process.
